## About Me

Diving into the world of coding, I've always been driven by the desire to create, innovate, and solve complex challenges. This portfolio stands testament to my commitment, learning experiences, and the zest with which I approach every coding problem.

## The Mission

The intensive bootcamp at The Ohio State University has been transformative. Each project, each line of code, reflects a phase of my learning journey, and through this portfolio, I aim to share those pivotal moments with you.

### Key Projects

1. **Bootcamp Study Guide**: Initiated as a prework assignment, this is a live document, continuously updated to mirror my expanding knowledge.
2. **Day One Repo**: This marks the commencement of my bootcamp â€” a repository filled with enthusiasm, excitement, and the anticipation of the journey ahead.
3. **Horiseon Website**: Here, I ventured into the intricacies of HTML and CSS, conceptualizing and executing a website for "Horiseon".
